By promoting classes and programs we hope to grow the number of women of color working in technology and give underprivileged girls a chance to become the masters of their technological worlds. Black Girls CODE\'s ultimate goal is to provide African-American youth with the skills to occupy some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. by 2020, and to train 1 million girls by 2040. \n \n We\'ve officially launched our #BlackGirlsCODETheWorld campaign; a celebration of the people who are embedded in the fabric of BGC\'s community and an opportunity for individuals to partner with us in empowering our #futuretechbosses to become innovators in STEM, leaders in their communities, and builders of their own futures.

        desc: 'The Environmental Justice Movement began in order to call attention to and organize against environmental racism, which is often left out of mainstream, largely white, environmental advocacy agendas. In 1991, a multinational group, including WE ACT, attended The First People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in Washington D.C. At the event, The Principles of Environmental Justice were created and agreed upon, and still stand as a guiding set of principles for the Environmental Justice Movement today. WE ACT is the lead organizer of the Environmental Justice Leadership Forum, and has provided effective leadership in the development of New York City and northeast region environmental justice alliances to network, collaborate and impact environmental policy-making. \n\n WE ACT’s mission is to build healthy communities by ensuring that people of color and/or low income residents participate meaningfully in the creation of sound and fair environmental health and protection policies and practices.'
