By reaching out to the community through workshops and after school programs, Black Girls CODE introduces computer coding lessons to young girls from underrepresented communities in programming languages such as Scratch or Ruby on Rails. Black Girls CODE has set out to prove to the world that girls of every color have the skills to become the programmers of tomorrow. By promoting classes and programs we hope to grow the number of women of color working in technology and give underprivileged girls a chance to become the masters of their technological worlds. Black Girls CODE\'s ultimate goal is to provide African-American youth with the skills to occupy some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. by 2020, and to train 1 million girls by 2040. \n \n We\'ve officially launched our #BlackGirlsCODETheWorld campaign; a celebration of the people who are embedded in the fabric of BGC\'s community and an opportunity for individuals to partner with us in empowering our #futuretechbosses to become innovators in STEM, leaders in their communities, and builders of their own futures.

We are still assessing the damages, but it is clear that over 250 Lake Street businesses experienced hundreds of millions of dollars in collective damage. While no property can measure up to the value of human life, the losses experienced by these businesses have had real human impacts.'
